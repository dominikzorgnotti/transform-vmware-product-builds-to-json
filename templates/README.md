# Machine readable VMware release data

This repo contains the release data of VMware products in a machine readable format (currently JSON) that enables you use the data easier in your scripts or other automation use-cases.  
The data is generated by a GitHub action running daily from [my transformation script](https://github.com/dominikzorgnotti/transform-vmware-builds-to-json).  
*note: It's still early days: Currently, only a subset of product data is available until this hits a more stable release.

## Output format and folder structures
Different use-cases, different ways to organize data.  
I will try to maintain a stable folder structure and data output formats but reserve the right to change it at any time.

## Disclamer

This is not an official VMware repository and in not linked in official capacity to my employment at VMware.    
All data is owned by VMware. I am just transforming the data VMware publishes in the knowledgebase and provide them in a different output format.
Errors can and will be made, please us this at your own discretion and test it out.
